[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findvision.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "vision", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "vision" with any
  of the following names:

    visionConfig.cmake
    vision-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "vision" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "vision_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "vision"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
